# Computational Intelligence Project 2023, Part 1
This is a repository for the development of an Artificial Neural Network for Human Activity Recognition. The model is trained on data from four sensors placed on four users for a total of 8 hours. It performs multiclass classification and is able to recognise the following five specific movements, "sitting-down", "standing-up", "standing", "walking", and "sitting".

Project part of Computational Intelligence course. CEID University of Patras.
